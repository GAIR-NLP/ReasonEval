Steps 9 and 10 provide the context for using the Pythagorean theorem to solve the problem. Step 11 involves applying the Pythagorean theorem, which is not necessary as the triangle need not be a right triangle, however, it offers a different way to look at the problem. Step 13 concludes that the triangle cannot be right, which is irrelevant to finding the length of the third side. Step 14 brings the focus back to the length of the third side in the context of potential hypotenuse values.
